# Today's .blue[Agenda]

### Session 1 - Introduction to Statistics

1. Basic concepts of **statistical analysis** `r ji("hatching")`

2. Descriptive statistics `r ji("bar_chart")`

### Session 2 - Introduction to R

1. Why R? Setup `r ji("plug")`

2. Data types, basic manipulations `r ji("floppy")`

3. Conditional statements, loops `r ji("infinity")`

4. **Fun**ctions `r ji("hugging")` , apply

1. Unstructured

2. Structured

- The data are stored in a tabular format.

- Cross-sectional / Time-series / Longitudinal / Spatial / Network

# The quality of data

Data is often far from perfect.

Frequently arising issues:

--

- missing data

--


- outliers

--

- duplication

--

- inconsistent data

## An illlustrative story of data-related issues

.blue[Statistician:] So, you got the data for all the patients?

.blue[Data Miner:] Yes. I haven't had much time for analysis, but I do have a few interesting results.

.blue[Statistician:] Amazing. There were so many data issues with this set of patients that I couldn't do much.

.blue[Data Miner:] Oh? I didn't hear about any possible problems. 

.blue[Statistician:] Well, first there is field 5, the variable we want to predict. It's common knowledge among people who analyze this type of data that results are better if you work with the log of the values, but I didn't discover this until later. Was it mentioned to you?

.blue[Data Miner:] No.

.footnote[*Introduction to Data Mining, page 21-22*]

## An illlustrative story of data-related issues

.blue[Statistician:] But surely you heard about what happened to field 4? It's supposed to be measured on a scale from 1 to 10, with 0 indicating a missing value, but because of a data entry error, all 10's were changed into 0's. Unfortunately, since some of the patients have missing values for this field, it's impossible to say whether a 0 in this field is a real 0 or a 10. Quite a few of the records have that problem.

.blue[Data Miner:] Interesting. Were there any other problems? .blue[Statistician:] Yes, fields 2 and 3 are basically the same, but I assume that you probably noticed that.

.blue[Data Miner:] Yes, but these fields were only weak predictors of field 5.

.blue[Statistician:] Anyway, given all those problems, I'm surprised you were able to accomplish anything.

.blue[Data Miner:] True, but my results are really quite good. Field 1 is a very strong predictor of field 5. I'm surprised that this wasn't noticed before.

.footnote[*Introduction to Data Mining, page 21-22*]

## An illlustrative story of data-related issues

.blue[Statistician:] What? Field 1 is just an identification number. 

.blue[Data Miner:] Nonetheless, my results speak for themselves.


.blue[Data Miner:] Nonetheless, my results speak for themselves. 

.blue[Statistician:] Oh, no! I just remembered. We assigned ID numbers after we sorted the records based on field 5. There is a strong connection, but it's meaningless. Sorry.
